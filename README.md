## Overview

AutoForm Genius is an innovative web application that revolutionizes form creation and data analysis through the power of artificial intelligence. It enables users to describe their form requirements in plain English and instantly generates fully functional forms. Beyond form creation, it provides intelligent data analysis, offering actionable insights and answering questions about the collected data.

### Key Features
- **AI-Powered Form Generation**: Create forms by simply describing what you need
- **Smart Data Analysis**: Get instant insights from your form responses
- **Natural Language Interface**: Interact with your data using everyday language
- **Real-time Form Preview**: See your form take shape as you describe it
- **Data Visualization**: Understand your form responses through intuitive charts and reports
